câu 811:: The lead investigator noticed that the witness's second statement seemed to ________ the initial evidence collected at the crime scene, creating a significant gap in the prosecution's timeline. Initially, the suspect claimed to be at a local diner, but GPS data from his vehicle placed him several miles away near the industrial docks at the exact time of the incident. This discrepancy forced the detectives to re-interview all parties involved, searching for any hidden motives or additional witnesses who could resolve the paradox. The legal team argued that such a blatant inconsistency rendered the testimony unreliable in a court of law. Consequently, the judge ordered a secondary forensic audit of all digital communications to determine if there was a coordinated effort to mislead the authorities or hide the truth.

While AI can process vast amounts of data and generate technically perfect images or music, critics argue that it lacks the "soul" or the personal experience that makes human art so compelling. There is a fear that as algorithms become more dominant in the industry, artists will feel pressured to conform to what is popular or easily predictable, rather than taking risks and exploring new forms of expression. To protect the diversity of the creative economy, many are calling for a balanced approach where technology serves as a tool to enhance human creativity rather than a replacement for it.
