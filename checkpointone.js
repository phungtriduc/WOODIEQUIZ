a:: Student A is correct, 6 notebooks per bag.
b:: Student B is correct, 3 notebooks per bag.
c:: Student B is correct, 4 notebooks per bag.
d:: Both are wrong, the maximum is 32 bags.

b:: The number of students who like Oranges is 50.
c:: More students like Bananas than Oranges.
d:: The total number of students who like Apples and Bananas covers $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the chart.
đáp án:: a,d
giải thích:: **TWM (Interpreting Data):** <br> - Apple: 50% of $200 = 100$ students (A is correct). <br> - Orange: $90^{\\circ}$ out of $360^{\\circ}$ is $\\frac{1}{4} = 25\%$. So Orange = 25% of $200 = 50$ students. <br> - Banana: 25% = Orange. So C is incorrect. <br> - Apple (50%) + Banana (25%) = 75% = $\\frac{3}{4}$ (D is correct).

câu 201:: A rectangular garden measures $12m$ in length and $8m$ in width. The gardener wants to install a fence around the entire perimeter of the garden. However, he needs to leave a $1m$ gap for a wooden gate. How many metres of fencing material does the gardener need to buy?
a:: $39m$
b:: $40m$
c:: $20m$
d:: $19m$
đáp án:: a

Student B's goes from 75 bpm to 130 bpm. Student C's stays exactly at 70 bpm. Which student's result is likely an error (anomalous result) and why?
a:: Student C, because pulse rate should increase with exercise to supply muscles with oxygen.

câu 853:: A musician is tuning a guitar. He plucks a string and it makes a low sound. He wants to make the pitch higher. To do this, he tightens the string using the tuning peg. By tightening the string, he increases the tension, which makes the string vibrate [[faster|slower]]. This increase in the frequency of vibration causes the pitch of the sound to become [[higher|lower]].
đáp án:: faster::1
đáp án:: higher::2
giải thích:: Pitch is determined by frequency. Tightening a string increases tension, causing faster vibrations and a higher pitch.

câu 854:: The Water Cycle explains how water moves around the Earth. Imagine a puddle of water on the pavement on a hot, sunny day. Over time, the puddle gets smaller and eventually disappears because the liquid water turns into invisible water vapour. Later, this vapour rises high into the atmosphere where it is cold, and it turns back into tiny liquid droplets to form clouds. What are the scientific names for these two processes, in the correct order?
a:: Evaporation then Condensation
b:: Condensation then Precipitation
c:: Melting then Freezing
d:: Evaporation then Boiling
đáp án:: a

câu 901:: A group of students wants to investigate how the height of a ramp affects the distance a toy car travels. They set up a wooden ramp and release the car from the top. They measure the distance the car rolls on the floor. To ensure a fair test, they keep the car and the floor surface the same. However, in the first test, they push the car down the ramp. In the second test, they just let it go. Why does pushing the car make the test unfair?
a:: Pushing adds an extra force, giving the car different amounts of energy each time.
b:: Pushing breaks the car's wheels.
c:: Pushing changes the force of gravity acting on the car.
d:: Pushing makes the ramp shorter.
đáp án:: a
giải thích:: In a fair test, the starting conditions must be identical. Pushing introduces a variable force that is hard to control, making the results unreliable. The car should be released from rest.

Suddenly, a disease kills all the oak trees. What is the most likely long-term effect on the sparrowhawk population?
a:: The sparrowhawk population will decrease because their food source (blue tits) will starve without caterpillars.
b:: The sparrowhawks will start eating oak leaves instead.
c:: The sparrowhawk population will increase because there are fewer trees blocking their flight.
d:: There will be no effect because sparrowhawks don't eat leaves.
đáp án:: a

They set up two dishes with moist cotton wool and 10 seeds in each. <br> Dish A: Placed on a sunny windowsill. <br> Dish B: Placed in a dark cupboard. <br> After 5 days, seeds in BOTH dishes have sprouted. <br> What does this experiment prove?
a:: Seeds need light to germinate.
b:: Seeds do not need light to germinate.
c:: The experiment failed.
d:: Seeds need soil to germinate.
đáp án:: b
